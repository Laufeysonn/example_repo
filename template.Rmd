I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r round(mean(samp),2)`.

# Section 3

## yeah

This is going to make a plot!



## what

```{r learning_assessment_1}
library(tidyverse)

la_df = tibble(
  norm_samp = rnorm(500, mean = 1),
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0,
  abs_norm_samp = abs(norm_samp)
)

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm_samp)) + geom_histogram()

median_samp = median(pull(la_df, norm_samp))
```

The median of the variable containing absolute values is 
`r round(median_samp, digits = 2)`.
